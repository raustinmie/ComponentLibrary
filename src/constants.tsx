const aboutUs_OurTeam = "Hi, we’re Austin and Sara Miedema! We’re the husband-and-wife team behind Harborview Web Design. We started this business to combine our strengths and we love working on something both creative and meaningful together. We live in a coastal town in Northwest Washington, just a few blocks from the harbor, with our four kids (ages 6–12). Family is at the heart of everything we do. When we’re not working, we’re probably playing board games, camping, or enjoying the outdoors together.";
